1.  ANAGRAM

        anagram.js

2.  Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted
    array of integers. The function should find the first pair
    where the sum is O. Return an array that includes both
    values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

            sumZero.js

3.  Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
    The function should return true if every value in the
    array has it's corresponding value squared in the second
    array. The frequency of values must be the same.

            same_naive_solution.js

4.  Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.
